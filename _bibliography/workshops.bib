abstract={The paper investigates the problem of deep learning model
selection. The authors propose a method of a neural architecture search
with respect to its desired complexity. As a complexity, we consider a
number of parameters that use selected architecture. The method is
based on a differential architecture search algorithm (DARTS). Instead
of optimizing structural parameters of the architecture, we consider them
as a function depending on the complexity parameter. To evaluate the
quality of the proposed algorithm we conduct experiments on a Fashion-MNIST dataset and compare the resulting architecture with DARTS
method},
